Natural Language Processing (NLP): Sentiment Analysis with LSTMs
Objective:
Train an LSTM model to classify text as positive or negative sentiment.

Dataset:
IMDB Movie Reviews

Steps:
Load the dataset and preprocess text (tokenization, padding).
Create a word embedding layer using TensorFlowâ€™s Embedding().
Build an LSTM model to process sequential data.
Train the model using binary cross-entropy loss.
Evaluate performance using accuracy and F1-score.
Set a target metric: Achieve at least 85% accuracy on test data.
